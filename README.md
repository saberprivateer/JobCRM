# JobCRM

Any job search is difficult.  While there are many services to help with job listings there isn't much support for each step afterwards.

Recruiters have sophisticated applicant tracking software (ATS).  "JobCRM" is an idea to help even the playing field by giving similar tools to the job searcher.

Enjoy!

P.S. As a former Mechanical Engineer and currently a Product Manager the quality of the code in this repo should not be taken seriously other than as a prototype and a chance for me to keep my skills up.
